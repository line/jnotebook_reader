```python
"default": {                                  # default config
    "server": {
        "port": 9088,                         # The port server listening on
        "root": "/jupyternb"                  # Context path, base url

        "directories": [                      # If type is local effective
            "/path/foo/bar/1",
            "/path/foo/bar/2"
        ],                                              
        "s3": {                               # s3 config, if type is s3 effective
            "endpoint": None,                 # s3 endpoint, if type is s3 required, if set with None would access to s3 global url

            "buckets": ["YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"],  # optional, default; request header "Bucket-Name" could replace it
        }
    },

### How to configure for local storage
You can configure multiple directories to be accessed by the jnotebook-viewer at the same time. Depending on your preference, you can set it as list or dict.
#### 1. "list" type
```
"directories": [
    "/path/foo/bar/1",
    "/path/foo/bar/2"
]
```
You can access it like: <br/>
http://localhost:9088/0 <br/>
http://localhost:9088/1
#### 2. "dict" type
```
"directories": {
    "a": "/path/foo/bar/1",
    "b": "/path/foo/bar/2"
}
```
You can access it like: <br/>
http://localhost:9088/a <br/>
http://localhost:9088/b
#### 3. single directory
```
"directories": "/path/foo/bar/1"
```
You can access it like: <br/>
http://localhost:9088/ANY
### How to configure for S3 storage
You can configure multiple buckets to be accessed by the jnotebook-reader at the same time. Depending on your preference, you can set it as list or dict.
#### 1. "list" type
```
"buckets": [
    "bucket_name_1",
    "bucket_name_2"
]
```
You can access it like: <br/>
http://localhost:9088/0 <br/>
http://localhost:9088/1
#### 2. "dict" type
```
"buckets": {
    "a": "bucket_name_1",
    "b": "bucket_name_2"
}
```
You can access it like: <br/>
http://localhost:9088/a <br/>
http://localhost:9088/b
#### 3. single bucket
```
"buckets": "bucket_name_1"
```
You can access it like: <br/>
http://localhost:9088/ANY
### How to configure with environment variables
You can set configuration through environment variables.
if environment variables set, the configuration file will be overwritten accordingly.
```bash
# Storage type, local or s3, default is local
JNOTEBOOK_READER_STORAGE_TYPE = "local"
# s3 endpoint, only for s3 storage type
JNOTEBOOK_READER_S3_ENDPOINT = ""
# s3 access key, only for s3 storage type
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = ""
# s3 secret key, only for s3 storage type
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = ""
# s3 bucket name, could set multiple, separated by ',' only for s3 storage type
JNOTEBOOK_READER_S3_BUCKET_NAME = ""
# local directories, could set multiple, separated by ',' only for local storage type
JNOTEBOOK_READER_DIR = ""
```

## :virgo: Production
If you want to release jnotebook_reader as a production service, it is recommended that you install [waitress-serve](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/runner.html) to manage your service.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/line/jnotebook-reader
cd jnotebook-reader
pip install -r requirements.txt
waitress-serve --call --listen=:9088 'app:create_app' &
```
## :aquarius: Docker
```bash
docker build -t jnotebook_reader -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 9088:9088 \
    -e JNOTEBOOK_READER_SERVER_PORT="9088" \
    -e JNOTEBOOK_READER_STORAGE_TYPE="s3" \
    -e JNOTEBOOK_READER_S3_ENDPOINT="S3_ENDPOINT" \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="S3_ACCESS_KEY" \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="S3_SECRET_KEY" \
    -e JNOTEBOOK_READER_S3_BUCKET_NAME="S3_BUCKET_NAME_1,S3_BUCKET_NAME_2" \
    -it --rm jnotebook_reader
```

## :pisces: Kubernetes
```bash
# Rollout jnotebook_reader deployment on Kubernetes cluster ( all resources are created in jnotebook-reader namespace )
kubectl apply -f docker/deployment.yml

# Get jnotebook_reader port
The examples deploy a NodePort service, so you have to check for the port it is mapped to:

kubectl get svc -n jnotebook-reader

Use the second port you find in the output to access jnotebook_reader, for instance:

NAME                   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
jnotebook-reader-svc   NodePort   172.19.66.29   <none>        9088:30693/TCP   25s

Type in browser -> http://{kubernetes_cluster_ip}:30693

# Destroy all resources
kubectl delete ns jnotebook-reader
```
